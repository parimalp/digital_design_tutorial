# Vivado Tutorial Using IP Integrator

## Introduction

This tutorial guides you through the design flow using Xilinx Vivado software to create a simple digital circuit using Vivado IP Integrator (IPI). A typical design flow consists of creating a Vivado project, optionally setting a user-defined IP library settings, creating a block design using various IP, creating a HDL wrapper, creating and/or adding user constraint file(s), optionally running behavioral simulation, synthesizing the design, implementing the design, generating the bitstream, and finally verifying the functionality in the hardware by downloading the generated bitstream file.  You will go through the typical design flow targeting the Spartan 7-50 based Boolean Board and Zynq-7020 based PYNQ-Z2. For Z2, you will be using an [RPI add-on board](https://www.tulembedded.com/FPGA/Products_RPI_Logic_Board.html), for adding more I/O resources. This add-on board plugs into the Raspberry Pi extension slot to provide extra accessible buttons and switches.

## Objectives

After completing this tutorial, you will be able to:

- Create a Vivado project targeting a specific FPGA device located on the Boolean or PYNQ-Z2 board

-  Use the provided partially completed Xilinx Design Constraint (XDC) file to constrain some of the I/O pin locations

-  Add additional constraints using the Tcl scripting feature of Vivado

- Simulate the design using the XSim simulator

- Synthesize and implement the design

- Generate the bitstream

- Configure the FPGA using the generated bitstream and verify the functionality

## Procedure

This tutorial is broken into steps that consist of general overview statements providing information on the detailed instructions that follow. Follow these detailed instructions to progress through the tutorial.

### Design Description

The design consists of  several inputs who are logically operated on before the results are output on the remaining LEDs and others are contained in a hierarchical block(the `add_on_block` in the diagram) as shown in the following figure.

<center>Partially completed design</center>

### Complete the design including rest of the switches and LDs with a hierarchical block

To create a 2-bit adder with the basic logic gates, we need to implement a half adder first. The truth table of a half adder is

| a    | b    | sum  | carry out |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | --------- |
| 0    | 0    | 0    | 0         |
| 0    | 1    | 1    | 0         |
| 1    | 0    | 1    | 0         |
| 1    | 1    | 0    | 1         |

derive the logical expression from the truth table above, we got

sum = a xor b
carry_out = a and b

A half adder consists of one exclusive or (XOR) gate and an AND gate, as shown in the following figure

<img src="img/Vivado_Tutorial_Using_IP_Integrator/half_adder_inter.png" alt="fig13" style="zoom:67%;" />

Internal Schematic of a Half Adder

Using two half adders, we can build a full adder. The truth table of a full adder is

| a    | b    | carry in | sum  | carry out |
| ---- | ---- | -------- | ---- | --------- |
| 0    | 0    | 0        | 0    | 0         |
| 0    | 0    | 1        | 1    | 0         |
| 0    | 1    | 0        | 1    | 0         |
| 0    | 1    | 1        | 0    | 1         |
| 1    | 0    | 0        | 1    | 0         |
| 1    | 0    | 1        | 0    | 1         |
| 1    | 1    | 0        | 0    | 1         |
| 1    | 1    | 1        | 1    | 1         |

Connecting the carry out of the first half adder to the input of the second adder, we can construct a full adder

Constraints file added for the Boolean board

6. In the *Sources* pane, expand the *Constraints* folder and double-click the **tutorial_{BOARD}.xdc**, **tutorial_boolean** for Boolean or **tutorial_z2.xdc**(for PYNQ-Z2) entry to open the file in text mode.

7. **In tutorial_{BOARD}.xdc**: Lines 10-16 define the pin locations of the input SW0-SW6 and lines 21-27 define the pin locations of the output LD0-LD6.

   **In tutorial_z2.xdc**: Lines 2-15 define the pin locations of the input SW0-SW6 and lines 24-37 define the pin locations of the output LD0-LD6.

   The SW7 and LD7 are deliberately left out so you can learn how to enter them using other methods.

### Perform RTL analysis on the source file

1. Expand the *Open Elaborated Design* entry under the *RTL Analysis* tasks of the *Flow Navigator* pane and click on **Schematic**.

2. Click **Save** if asked.

   The model (design) will be elaborated and a logic view of the design is displayed.

3. Click on the **+** sign inside the block to see its content. Use the *Zoom Full(![image-20211227164120619](img/Vivado_Tutorial_Using_IP_Integrator/image-20211227164120619.png))* button to see the entire design.

   **For PYNQ-Z2**: Type **M**  in the field to jump to Mxx  pins, scroll-down until you see M14 , select M14 and hit the *Enter* key to assign the pin.

4. You can also assign the pin constraints using tcl commands. Type in the following command in the Tcl Console tab to assign the *P2* (Boolean) pin location and the *LVCSMOS33* I/O standard to **SW7** hitting the Enter key after each command.

   **Boolean:**

   ```tcl
   set_property -dict {PACKAGE_PIN P2 IOSTANDARD LVCMOS33} [get_ports {SW7}]
   ```
   **PYNQ-Z2**

   ```tcl
   set_property -dict {PACKAGE_PIN W9 IOSTANDARD LVCMOS33} [get_ports {SW7}]
   ```

   Observe the pin and I/O standard assignments in the I/O Ports tab. You can also assign the pin by selecting its entry (SW7) in the I/O ports tab, and dragging it to the Package view, and placing it at the P2 (Boolean) location. You can assign the LVCMOS33 standard by selecting its entry (SW7), selecting Configure tab of the I/O Port Properties window, followed by clicking the drop-down button of the I/O standard field, and selecting LVCMOS33.

The testbench defines the simulation step size and the resolution in line 1. The testbench module definition begins on line 5. Line 11 instantiates the DUT (device/module under test). Lines 29 through 38 define the same module functionality for the expected value computation. Lines 40 through 51 define the stimuli generation and compares the expected output with what the DUT provides. Line 53 ends the testbench. The $display task will print the message in the simulator console window when the simulation is run.

### Simulate the design for 1000 ns using the XSim Simulator

1. Select **Simulation Settings** by right-clicking on the **SIMULATION** under the *Project Manager* tasks of the *Flow Navigator* pane.

   A **Project Settings** form will appear showing the **Simulation** properties form.

2. Select the **Simulation** tab, and set the **Simulation Run Time** value to 200 ns and click **OK**.

3. Click on **Run Simulation > Run Behavioral Simulation** under the *Project Manager* tasks of the *Flow Navigator* pane.

   The testbench and source files will be compiled and the XSim simulator will be run (assuming no errors). You will see a simulator output similar to the one shown below.

<img src="img/Vivado_Tutorial_Using_IP_Integrator/fig27.png" alt="fig27" style="zoom:67%;" />

Simulator output

   You will see four main views:

(i) *Scopes,* where the testbench hierarchy as well as glbl instances are displayed,

(ii) *Objects,* where top-level signals are displayed,

(iii) the waveform window, and

(iv) *Tcl Console* where the simulation activities are displayed. Notice that since the testbench used is self-checking, the results are displayed as the simulation is run.

Notice that the **tutorial.sim** directory is created under the **tutorial** directory, along with several lower-level directories.

## Step 5 Synthesize the Design

### Synthesize the design with the Vivado synthesis tool and analyze the Project Summary output  

1. Click on **Run Synthesis** under the *Synthesis* tasks of the *Flow Navigator* pane.

   The synthesis process will be run on the tutorial.v file (and all its hierarchical files if they exist). When the process is completed a *Synthesis Completed* dialog box with three options will be displayed.

2. Select the *Open Synthesized Design* option and click **OK** as we want to look at the synthesis output before progressing to the implementation stage.

   Click **Yes** to close the elaborated design if the dialog box is displayed.

3. Select the **Project Summary** tab (Select default layout if the tab is not visible) and understand the various windows.

<img src="img/Vivado_Tutorial_Using_IP_Integrator/fig32.png" alt="fig13" style="zoom:67%;" />

Project Summary view(Taking Pynq-Z2 as an example)

Click on the various links to see what information they provide and which allows you to change the synthesis settings.

4. Click on the **Table** tab in the **Project Summary** tab.

   Notice that there are an estimated 16 IOs (8 input and 8 output) that are used.

## Step 6 Implement the Design

### Implement the design with the Vivado Implementation Defaults settings and analyze the Project Summary output

1. Click on **Run Implementation** under the *Implementation* tasks of the *Flow Navigator* pane.

   The implementation process will be run on the synthesis output files. When the process is completed an *Implementation Completed* dialog box with three options will be displayed.

2. Select **Open implemented design** and click **OK** as we want to look at the implemented design in a Device view tab.

3. Click **Yes** to close the synthesized design.

   The implemented design will be opened.

4. In the *Netlist* pane, select one of the nets (e.g. n_0_design_1_i) and notice that the displayed net.

<img src="img/Vivado_Tutorial_Using_IP_Integrator/fig36.png" alt="fig13" style="zoom:67%;" />

Selecting a net

<img src="img/Vivado_Tutorial_Using_IP_Integrator/fig37.png" alt="fig13" style="zoom:67%;" />

Viewing implemented design

5. Close the implemented design view and select the **Project Summary** tab (you may have to change to the Default Layout view) and observe the results.

   Notice that the actual resource utilization is 15 LUTs and 16 IOs. Also, it indicates that no timing constraints were defined for this design (since the design is combinatorial). Select the **Post-implementation** tabs under the *Timing* and *Utilization* windows.

6. Using the Windows Explorer, verify that **impl_1** directory is created at the same level as **synth_1** under the **tutorial.runs** directory. The **impl_1** directory contains several files including the report files.

7. Select the **Reports** tab, and double-click on the *Utilization Report* entry under the *Place Design* section. The report will be displayed in the auxiliary view pane showing resources utilization. Note that since the design is combinatorial no registers are used.

## Step 7 Perform Timing Simulation

### Run a timing simulation

1. Select **Run Simulation > Run Post-Implementation Timing Simulation** process under the *Simulation* tasks of the *Flow Navigator* pane.

   The XSim simulator will be launched using the implemented design and the **tutorial_tb** as the top-level module.

   Using the Windows Explorer, verify that **timing** directory is created under the **tutorial.sim > sim_1 > impl** directory. The **timing** directory contains generated files to run the timing simulation.

2. Click on the **Zoom Fit** button to see the waveform window from 0 to 200 ns.

3. Right-click at 120 ns (where the switch input is set to 00000010 [decimal 2]) and select **Markers > Add Marker**.

4. Similarly, right-click and add a marker at around 120.000 ns where the **leds** changes.

5. You can also add a marker by clicking on the Add Marker button (![image-20211229114109951](img/Vivado_Tutorial_Using_IP_Integrator/image-20211229114109951.png)). Click on the **Add Marker** button and left-click at around 60 ns where **e_led** changes.

<img src="img/Vivado_Tutorial_Using_IP_Integrator/fig38.png" alt="fig13" style="zoom:67%;" />

Timing simulation output

Notice that we monitored the expected led output at 20 ns after the input is changed (see the testbench) whereas the actual delay is about 22.000 ns. A mismatch error will appear in the console window.

<img src="img/Vivado_Tutorial_Using_IP_Integrator/fig38_console_output.png" alt="fig13" style="zoom:67%;" />

Timing simulation console output

6. Close the simulator by selecting **File > Close Simulation** without saving any changes.

## Step 8 Generate the Bitstream and Verify Functionality

### Connect the board and power it ON. Generate the bitstream, open a hardware session, and program the FPGA  

1. Click on the **Generate Bitstream** entry under the *Program and Debug* tasks of the *Flow Navigator* pane.

   The bitstream generation process will be run on the implemented design. When the process is completed a *Bitstream Generation* *Completed* dialog box with three options will be displayed.

   This process will have **design_1_wrapper.bit** file generated under **impl_1** directory which was generated under the **tutorial.runs** directory.

2. Make sure that the power supply source is jumper to *USB* and the provided Micro-USB cable is connected between the board and the PC.

   Note that you do not need to connect the power jack and the board can be powered and configured via USB alone

<img src="img/Vivado_Tutorial_Using_IP_Integrator/fig39.png" alt="fig13" style="zoom:67%;" />

 Board settings for Boolean

For PYNQ-Z2, make sure that the jumper is set up **USB**(the left arrow) and **JTAG**(the right arrow)

<img src="img/Vivado_Tutorial_Using_IP_Integrator/z2_setup.png" alt="fig13" style="zoom:67%;" />

3. Power **ON** the switch on the board.

4. Select the *Open Hardware Manager* option and click **OK**.

   The Hardware Session window will open indicating “unconnected” status.

5. Click on the **Open target** link or the **Auto connect** button.

8. Click **Program** to program the FPGA with the selected bitstream.

   The DONE light will lit when the device is programmed. You may see some LEDs lit depending on the switches position.

9. Verify the functionality by flipping switches and observing the output on the LEDs.

10. Close the hardware session by selecting **File > Close Hardware Manager.**

11. Click **OK** to close the session.

12. Power **OFF** the board.

13. Close the **Vivado** program by selecting **File > Exit** and click **OK**.

## Conclusion

The Vivado software tool can be used to perform a complete design flow. The project was created using the XUP IP library (IPI blocks and user constraint file). A behavioral simulation was done to verify the model functionality. The model was then synthesized, implemented, and a bitstream was generated. The timing simulation was run on the implemented design using the same testbench. The functionality was verified in hardware using the generated bitstream.
