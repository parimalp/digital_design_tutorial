# Buidling Basic Elements for IPI

## Introduction

This tutorial guides you through creating basic elements which can be used in basic digital design course. The steps can be used to extend it to creating IP of any complexity.

## Objectives

After completing this tutorial, you will be able to:

- Use Create and Package IP feature of Vivado to create IP

- Simulate and verify IP functionality

- Generate the bitstream and verify the functionality in hardware

## Procedure

This tutorial is separated into steps that consist of general overview statements that provide information on the detailed instructions that follow. Follow these detailed instructions to progress through the tutorial.

This tutorial comprises 4 primary steps: You will create two custom IPs in Vivado, create another project to use the created IPs, simulate the design, and verify the functionality in the hardware.

##  In the instructions for the tutorial

The absolute path for the source code should only contain ascii characters. Deep path should also be avoided since the maximum supporting length of path for Windows is 260 characters.

**{SOURCES}** refers to *\\digital_design_tutorial\\source\\create_your_own_IPI_block*. You can download the source files for the tutorials from the cloned sources directory

**{TUTORIAL}** refers to *C:\digital_design_tutorial\\*. It assumes that you will create the mentioned directory structure to carry out the tutorials of this workshop

## Step 1 Create a Project for Creating IP in Vivado

   This process will have **design_1_wrapper.bit** file generated under **impl_1** directory which was generated under the **tutorial.runs** directory.

2. Make sure that the power supply source is jumper to *USB* and the provided Micro-USB cable is connected between the board and the PC.

   Note that you do not need to connect the power jack and the board can be powered and configured via USB alone
